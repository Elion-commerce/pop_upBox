The "Cover" class is used to creat the overlay feel  the color and opacity can be edited in the Css file.

The "pop_nav"  can be edited by changing the text and the image (I made the cancel icon my self so feel free to use it ) having the "close"
id

The class "pop_content" The information or The promt foR raction is to be inputed here

The class "action_btn" This button can be used to triger any event its left to you to decide

The Class "Mian" note this is where all the main content of the web page is to be placed

The button of Id "pop" is used with the ID "close" to toggle the pop up box effect on and off
NOTE the button with the Id "pop" can be placed any where in the webpage used sinple Css

The sole aim of the Java Script file was to achieve the toggling of the pop up box "ON and OFF"
